## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this project I learned about the classList function, that is able to toggle a class on and off from a HTML element. Using it, I don't need to write if...else statements adding and removing properties, and it is able to save a lot of lines of codes.
